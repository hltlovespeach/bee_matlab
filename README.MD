# References
This repository contains the codes for my third-year bachelors's extended essay titled "Computational Optimal Transport with Applications in Machine Learning". The essay can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1svdbMCk1v5KFh2Nq7rKMOaOhZ2Wedc6Y/view?usp=sharing).  
The codes are modified based on [1]. A version of the APDAGD algorithm is added based on the previous work from [2].

# Input Generations
(all in 'input_generation/' sub-directory)\
Contains code creating OT instances out of images (either synthetically generated or MNIST).
